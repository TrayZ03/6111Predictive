# Customer Attrition Prediction Model

This project develops a supervised classification model to predict customer attrition for ABC Corporation using R. Comparing logistic regression and K-nearest neighbors algorithms, the analysis reveals logistic regression provides superior performance with higher accuracy and better ROC curve characteristics. The model leverages demographic, behavioral, and service-related features, augmented with engineered variables including average transaction amounts, monthly spending patterns, transaction frequency, and credit utilization ratios. The calibration curves demonstrate logistic regression's more reliable probability estimates compared to KNN's tendency to overestimate attrition risk. This model enables ABC Corporation to identify customers at high risk of attrition for targeted retention campaigns, potentially increasing customer lifetime value and overall revenue.
